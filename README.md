## Introduction

This project aims to apply data-driven algortithms to various sets of data and obtain very close approximations to the underlying governing equations that generates the data. In addition, assistance in conditioning the data properly, for feeding into the algorithm as well as reducing the dimensionality, has been utilized by incorporating decomposition methods like POD and DMD.

## Project Objectives

- Employ **linear regression** techniques to approximate governing equations for simple dynamical systems, establishing a baseline for comparison with more advanced methods.
- Use **Lasso Regression** in order to promote **sparsity** in the predicted model.
- Apply **decomposition methods** to extract dominant modes from the data and analyze the terms involved for generating these dominant modes.
- Achieving **noise reduction** through the decomposition algorithms.
